2. Each row of this table gives information about the name of a country, the continent to which it belongs, its area, the population, and its GDP value.

2. it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).

Write a solution to find the name, population, and area of the big countries.

Return the result table in any order.

```sql
select name, population, area from World where AREA >= 3000000 or population  >= 25000000;
